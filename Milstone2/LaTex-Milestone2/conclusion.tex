\uline{Questions}: Q4. Why should the community care?\\
\noindent\uline{Should do}: 
- Overview of Q1, Q2, and Q3; plus\\
- What does the community still not know?\\
}

\noindent\uline{Examples}:
- We have introduced a method of ....\\
- Most of our effort has focused on .... The results of our method often contain .... We believe that there is significant room for improvement by applying ABC methods to the XYZ problem.\\
- What do we not do?\\

In this study, we established a method for ... Although we focused on discrete path planning of platonic solid - regular convex polyhedra in known environment, as illustrated using ABC model and EFG example, the developed method/algorithm can be easily implemented to the complex convex polyhedra such as elipsoil ???. The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows:\\
