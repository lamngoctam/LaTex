Examples: from "2018 Path Planning of Industrial Robot - RRT"

With the development of modern manufacturing industry,the application scenarios of industrial robot are becoming more and more complex. Manual programming of industrial robot requires a great deal of effort and time. \textbf{Therefore}, an autonomous path planning is an important development direction of industrial robot. 

Among the path planning methods, the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm based on random sampling has been widely applied for a high-dimensional robotic manipulator because of its probability completeness and outstanding expansion. \textbf{However}, especially in the complex scenario, the existing RRT planning algorithms still have a low planning efficiency and some are easily fall into a local minimum. 

\textbf{To tackle these problems}, this paper proposes an autonomous path planning method for the robotic manipulator based on an improved RRT algorithm. The method introduces regression mechanism to prevent over-searching configuration space. 
\textbf{In addition}, it adopts an adaptive expansion mechanism to continuously improve reachable spatial information by refining the boundary nodes in joint space, avoiding repeatedly searching for extended nodes. 
\textbf{Furthermore}, it avoids the unnecessary iteration of the robotic manipulator forward kinematics solution and its time-consuming collision detection in Cartesian space. The method can rapidly plan a path to a target point and can be accelerated out of a local minimum area to improve path planning efficiency. 

The improved RRT algorithm proposed in this paper is simulated in a complex environment. The results reveal that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the success rate and efficiency of the planning without losing other performance.\\
