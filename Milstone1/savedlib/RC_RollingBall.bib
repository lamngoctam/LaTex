   abstract = {We consider a nonholonomic system describing the rolling of a dynamically nonsymmetric sphere over a fixed sphere without slipping. The system generalizes the classical nonholonomic Chaplygin sphere problem and it is shown to be integrable for one special ratio of radii of the spheres. After a time reparameterization the system becomes a Hamiltonian one and admits a separation of variables and reduction to Abel-Jacobi quadratures. The separating variables that we found appear to be a non-trivial generalization of ellipsoidal (spheroconic) coordinates on the Poisson sphere, which can be useful in other integrable problems. Using the quadratures we also perform an explicit integration of the problem in theta-functions of the new time.},

   abstract = {This paper can be regarded as a continuation of our previous work [1, 2] on the hierarchy of the dynamical behavior of nonholonomic systems. We consider different mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints; in particular, we examine the existence of tensor invariants (laws of conservation) and their connection with the behavior of a system. Considerable attention is given to the possibility of conformally Hamiltonian representation of the equations of motion, which is mainly used for the integration of the considered systems.},
