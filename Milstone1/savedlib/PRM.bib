   abstract = {This paper presents a generalization of the classic A* algorithm to the domain of sampling-based motion planning. The root assumptions of the A* algorithm are examined and reformulated in a manner that enables a direct use of the search strategy as the driving force behind the generation of new samples in a motion graph. Formal analysis is presented to show probabilistic completeness and convergence of the method. This leads to a highly exploitative method which does not sacrifice entropy. Many improvements are presented to this versatile method, most notably, an optimal connection strategy, a bias towards the goal region via an Anytime A* heuristic, and balancing of exploration and exploitation on a simulated annealing schedule. Empirical results are presented to assess the proposed method both qualitatively and quantitatively in the context of high-dimensional planning problems. The potential of the proposed methods is apparent, both in terms of reliability and quality of solutions found.},

   abstract = {This paper deals with motion planning for robots manipulating movable objects among obstacles. We propose a general manipulation planning approach capable of addressing continuous sets for modeling both the possible grasps and the stable placements of the movable object, rather than discrete sets generally assumed by the previous approaches. The proposed algorithm relies on a topological property that characterizes the existence of solutions in the subspace of configurations where the robot grasps the object placed at a stable position. It allows us to devise a manipulation planner that captures in a probabilistic roadmap the connectivity of sub-dimensional manifolds of the composite configuration space. Experiments conducted with the planner in simulated environments demonstrate its efficacy to solve complex manipulation problems.},
