   abstract = {It has long been speculated that space–time could, in nature, be discrete. In this paper, the author discusses how stochastic tools can be used to describe kinematics in discrete space–time. This description of kinematics considers the time evolution as a random walk that allows time to flow both forwards and backwards — but with bias preferring the forward flow. With this framework, the author gives a solution to the galaxy rotation problem without introducing dark matter. A Dirac equation is also introduced suiting this framework, which allows one to introduce the gravitational influence — via the time-bias term — to a quantum system.},
