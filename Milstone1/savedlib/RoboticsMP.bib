   abstract = {We propose a new approach to robot path planning that consists of building and searching a graph connecting the local minima of a potential function defined over the robot's configuration space. A planner based on this approach has been implemented. This planner is consider ably faster than previous path planners and solves prob lems for robots with many more degrees of freedom (DOFs). The power of the planner derives both from the "good" properties of the potential function and from the efficiency of the techniques used to escape the local min ima of this function. The most powerful of these tech niques is a Monte Carlo technique that escapes local min ima by executing Brownian motions. The overall approach is made possible by the systematic use of distributed rep resentations (bitmaps) for the robot's work space and configuration space. We have experimented with the plan ner using several computer-simulated robots, including rigid objects with 3 DOFs (in 2D work space) and 6 DOFs (in 3D work space) and manipulator arms with 8, 10, and 31 DOFs (in 2D and 3D work spaces). Some of the most significant experiments are reported in this article.},

Our approach is extensible, probabilistically complete, and offers improved performance and generality compared with a similar, state-of-the-art planner. The key idea is to leverage incremental constraint solving to efficiently incorporate geometric information at the task level. Using motion feasibility information to guide task planning improves scalability of the overall planner. Our key abstractions address the requirements of manipulation and object rearrangement. We validate our approach on a physical manipulator and evaluate scalability on scenarios with many objects and long plans, showing order-of-magnitude gains compared with the benchmark planner and improved scalability from additional geometric guidance. Finally, in addition to describing a new method for TMP and its implementation on a physical robot, we also put forward requirements and abstractions for the development of similar planners in the future.},

   abstract = {Service robots require easy programming methods allowing the unexperienced human user to easily integrate motion and perception skills or complex problem solving strategies. To achieve this goal, robots should learn from operators how and what to do considering hard- and software constraints. Various approaches modelling the man-machine skill transfer have been proposed. Systems following the Programming by Demonstration (PbD) paradigm that were developed within the last decade are getting closer to this goal. However, most of these systems lack the possibility for the user to supervise and influence the process of program generation after the initial demonstration was performed. In this paper a principle learning methodology is discussed, which allows to transfer human skills and to supervise the learning process including subsymbolic and symbolic task knowledge. Here, several existing approaches will be discussed and compared to each other. Moreover, a system approach is presented, integrating the overall process of skill transfer from a human to a robotic manipulation system. One major goal is to modify information gained by the demonstration in that way that different target systems are supported. The resulting PbD-system yields towards a hybrid learning approach in robotics to support natural programming based on human demonstrations and user advice.},

   abstract = {Robots with many degrees of freedom (e.g., humanoid robots and mobile manipulators) have increasingly been employed to accomplish realistic tasks in domains such as disaster relief, spacecraft logistics, and home caretaking. Finding feasible motions for these robots autonomously is essential for their operation. Sampling-based motion planning algorithms are effective for these high-dimensional systems; however, incorporating task constraints (e.g., keeping a cup level or writing on a board) into the planning process introduces significant challenges. This survey describes the families of methods for sampling-based planning with constraints and places them on a spectrum delineated by their complexity. Constrained sampling-based methods are based on two core primitive operations: (a) sampling constraint-satisfying configurations and (b) generating constraint-satisfying continuous motion. Although this article presents the basics of sampling-based planning for contextual background, it focuses on the representation of constraints and sampling-based planners that incorporate constraints.},

   abstract = {We propose a general strategy for solving the motion planning problem for real analytic, controllable systems without drift. The procedure starts by computing a control that steers the given initial point to the desired target point for an extended system, in which a number of Lie brackets of the system vector fields are added to the right-hand side. The main point then is to use formal calculations based on the product expansion relative to a P. Hall basis, to produce another control that achieves the desired result on the formal level. It then turns out that this control provides an exact solution of the original problem if the given system is nilpotent. When the system is not nilpotent, one can still produce an iterative algorithm that converges very fast to a solution. Using the theory of feedback nilpotentization, one can find classes of non-nilpotent systems for which the algorithm, in cascade with a precompensator, produces an exact solution in a finite number of steps. We also include results of simulations which illustrate the effectiveness of the procedure.},

Computing such a path has a computational complexity scaling exponentially with the dimensionality of the configuration space. We propose to reduce the dimensionality of the configuration space by introducing the irreducible path — a path having a minimal swept volume. The paper consists of three parts: In part I, we define the space of all irreducible paths and show that planning a path in the irreducible path space preserves completeness of any motion planning algorithm. In part II, we construct an approximation to the irreducible path space of a serial kinematic chain under certain assumptions. In part III, we conduct motion planning using the irreducible path space for a mechanical snake in a turbine environment, for a mechanical octopus with eight arms in a pipe system and for the sideways motion of a humanoid robot moving through a room with doors and through a hole in a wall. We demonstrate that the concept of an irreducible path can be applied to any motion planning algorithm taking curvature constraints into account.},

In particular, we analyze and generate gaits for mixed mechanical systems which are systems whose motion is simultaneously governed by both a set of non-holonomic velocity constraints and a notion of a generalized momentum being instantaneously conserved along allowable directions of motion. Through proper recourse to geometric mechanics, we are able to show that the resulting motion from a gait has two portions: a geometric and a dynamic contribution. The main challenge in motion planning for a mixed system is understanding how to separate the geometric and dynamic contributions of motion due to a general gait, thus simplifying gait analysis. In this paper, we take the first step towards addressing this challenge in a generalized framework. Finally, we verify the generality of our approach by applying our techniques to novel mechanical systems which we introduce in this paper as well as by verifying that seemingly different prior motion planning results could actually be explained using the gait analysis presented in this paper.},

What is unique about mixed systems is that when we express their dynamics in body coordinates, the motion of these system can be attributed to two decoupled terms: the geometric and dynamic phase shifts. In our prior work, we analyzed systems whose dynamic phase shift was null by definition. Purely mechanical and principally kinematic systems are two classes of mechanical systems that have this property. We generated gaits for these two classes of systems by intuitively evaluating their geometric phase shift and relating it to a volume integral under well-defined height functions.},

   abstract = {In this article, a recently developed learning approach for robot motion planning is extended and applied to two types of carlike robots: normal ones, and robots that can only move for ward. In this learning approach the motion planning process is split into two phases: the learning phase and the query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is incremen tally constructed in configuration space. This roadmap is an undirected graph where nodes correspond to randomly chosen configurations in free space and edges correspond to simple collision-free paths between the nodes. These simple motions are computed using a fast local method. In the query phase, this roadmap can be used to find paths between different pairs of configurations.The approach can be applied to normal carlike robots (with nonholonomic constraints) by using suitable local methods that compute paths feasible for the robots. Application to carlike robots that can move only forward demands a more fundamen tal adaptation of the learning method; that is, the roadmaps must be stored in directed graphs instead of undirected ones.We have implemented the planners, and we present experi mental results that demonstrate their efficiency for both robot types, even in cluttered workspaces. Also, we prove probabilis tic completeness of the planners.1. A robot is fully controllable iff the existence of a path in the open free C space implies the existence of a feasible path.2. By "metric," we simply mean a function of type C x C ? R+ without any restrictions.3. Formally, this requires a minor adaptation of the general outline of the learning algorithm, as presented in Section 3.1. Line 7. will be: if -connected(c, n) ? L( c, n) ? free C space then E = E U {(c, n)}.4. This does not necessarily hold if P1 consists of just one or two circular arcs of maximal curvature. In this case, however, P1 can be found directly with the local planner.5. We say a path Q lies within distance ? of a path R, iff ?q ? Q : ?r ? R : |q - r| ≤ ? (in C space).},
