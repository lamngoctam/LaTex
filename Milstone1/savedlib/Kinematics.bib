   abstract = {Robots in applications may be subject to holonomic or nonholonomic constraints. Examples of holonomic constraints include a manipulator constrained through the contact with the environment, e.g., inserting a part, turning a crank, etc., and multiple manipulators constrained through a common payload. Examples of nonholonomic constraints include no—slip constraints on mobile robot wheels, local normal rotation constraints for soft finger and rolling contacts in grasping, and conservation of angular momentum of in—orbit space robots. The above examples all involve equality constraints; in applications, there are usually additional inequality constraints such as robot joint limits, self collision and environment collision avoidance constraints, steering angle constraints in mobile robots, etc.},

   abstract = {The intrinsically redundant series manipulator's kinematics were studied by the exponential product formula of screw theory, the direct kinematics problem and Inverse kinematics problems were analyzed, and the intrinsically redundant series manipulator's kinematics solution that based on exponential product formulas were proposed; the intrinsically redundant series manipulator's kinematics is decomposed into several simple sub-problems, then analyzed sub-problem, and set an example to validate the correctness of the proposed method. Finally, comparing the exponential product formula and the D-H parameters, draw that they are essentially the same in solving the manipulator's kinematics, so as to the algorithm of the manipulator's kinematics based on exponential product formulas are correct, and the manipulator's kinematics process based on exponential product formula is more simple and easier to real-time control of industrial.},

   abstract = {We present a method for kinematic calibration of open chain mechanisms based on the product of exponentials (POE) formula. The POE formula represents the forward kinematics of an open chain as a product of matrix exponentials, and is based on a modern geometric interpretation of classical screw theory. Unlike the kinematic representations based on the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters, the kinematic parameters in the POE formula vary smoothly with changes in the joint axes; ad hoc methods designed to address the inherent singularities in the D-H parameters are therefore unnecessary. After introducing the POE formula, we derive a least-squares kinematic calibration algorithm for general open chain mechanisms.},

   abstract = {The human hand’s versatility allows for robust and flexible grasping. To obtain such efficiency, many robotic hands include human biomechanical features such as fingers having their two last joints mechanically coupled. Although such coupling enables human-like grasping, controlling the inverse kinematics of such mechanical systems is challenging. Here we propose a cortical model for fine motor control of a humanoid finger, having its two last joints coupled, that learns the inverse kinematics of the effector. This neural model functionally mimics the population vector coding as well as sensorimotor prediction processes of the brain’s motor/premotor and parietal regions, respectively. After learning, this neural architecture could both overtly (actual execution) and covertly (mental execution or motor imagery) perform accurate, robust and flexible finger movements while reproducing the main human finger kinematic states. This work contributes to developing neuro-mimetic controllers for dexterous humanoid robotic/prosthetic upper-extremities, and has the potential to promote human–robot interactions.},

   abstract = {This paper deals with several of the basic concepts in the kinematics of mechanical hands. Several different types of finger contacts are modeled and used in a number synthesis of three-fingered hands. Screw theory is used to show which finger configurations allow complete immobilization of the gripped object relative to the fingers, and also allow for the manipulation of the object by the fingers while maintaining the grasp. Shown in this paper is how to determine the forces applied by the fingers on the object, and also how to compute the velocities of the fingers and the object. The analysis developed in this paper is shown to lead to a hand with three fingers, each with three turning joints, and having friction contacts with an object at three separate points.},
