   abstract = {We consider a general theory of curvatures of discrete surfaces equipped with edgewise parallel Gauss images, and where mean and Gaussian curvatures of faces are derived from the faces’ areas and mixed areas. Remarkably these notions are capable of unifying notable previously defined classes of surfaces, such as discrete isothermic minimal surfaces and surfaces of constant mean curvature. We discuss various types of natural Gauss images, the existence of principal curvatures, constant curvature surfaces, Christoffel duality, Koenigs nets, contact element nets, s-isothermic nets, and interesting special cases such as discrete Delaunay surfaces derived from elliptic billiards.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a unified and consistent set of flexible tools to approximate important geometric attributes, including normal vectors and curvatures on arbitrary triangle meshes. We present a consistent derivation of these first and second order differential properties using averaging Voronoi cells and the mixed Finite-Element/Finite-Volume method, and compare them to existing formulations. Building upon previous work in discrete geometry, these operators are closely related to the continuous case, guaranteeing an appropriate extension from the continuous to the discrete setting: they respect most intrinsic properties of the continuous differential operators. We show that these estimates are optimal in accuracy under mild smoothness conditions, and demonstrate their numerical quality. We also present applications of these operators, such as mesh smoothing, enhancement, and quality checking, and show results of denoising in higher dimensions, such as for tensor images.},

   abstract = {The numerical integration of geometric partial differential equations is used in many applications such as image processing, surface processing, computer graphics and computer-aided geometric design. Discrete approximations of several first- and second-order geometric differential operators, such as the tangential gradient operator, the second tangential operator, the Laplace–Beltrami operator and the Giaquinta–Hildebrandt operator, are utilized in the numerical integrations. In this paper, we consider consistent discretized approximations of these operators based on a quadratic fitting scheme. An asymptotic error analysis is conducted which shows that under very mild conditions the discrete approximations of the first- and second-order geometric differential operators have quadratic and linear convergence rates, respectively.},
