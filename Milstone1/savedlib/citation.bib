   journal = {Journal of Mechanical Design},

   note = {10.1115/1.4027759},
   abstract = {The complex kinematic structure of a human thumb makes it difficult to capture and control the thumb motions. A further complication is that mapping the fingertip position alone leads to inadequate grasping postures for current robotic hands, many of which are equipped with tactile sensors on the volar side of the fingers. This paper aimed to use a data glove as the input device to teleoperate the thumb of a humanoid robotic hand. An experiment protocol was developed with only minimum hardware involved to compensate for the differences in kinematic structures between a robotic hand and a human hand. A nonlinear constrained-optimization formulation was proposed to map and calibrate the motion of a human thumb to that of a robotic thumb by minimizing the maximum errors (minimax algorithms) of fingertip position while subject to the constraint of the normals of the surfaces of the thumb and the index fingertips within a friction cone. The proposed approach could be extended to other teleoperation applications, where the master and slave devices differ in kinematic structure.},

The system generalizes the classical nonholonomic Chaplygin sphere problem and it is shown to be integrable for one special ratio of radii of the spheres. After a time reparameterization the system becomes a Hamiltonian one and admits a separation of variables and reduction to Abel-Jacobi quadratures. The separating variables that we found appear to be a non-trivial generalization of ellipsoidal (spheroconic) coordinates on the Poisson sphere, which can be useful in other integrable problems. Using the quadratures we also perform an explicit integration of the problem in theta-functions of the new time.},

   abstract = {It has long been speculated that space–time could, in nature, be discrete. In this paper, the author discusses how stochastic tools can be used to describe kinematics in discrete space–time. This description of kinematics considers the time evolution as a random walk that allows time to flow both forwards and backwards — but with bias preferring the forward flow. With this framework, the author gives a solution to the galaxy rotation problem without introducing dark matter. A Dirac equation is also introduced suiting this framework, which allows one to introduce the gravitational influence — via the time-bias term — to a quantum system.},

We present a consistent derivation of these first and second order differential properties using averaging Voronoi cells and the mixed Finite-Element/Finite-Volume method, and compare them to existing formulations. Building upon previous work in discrete geometry, these operators are closely related to the continuous case, guaranteeing an appropriate extension from the continuous to the discrete setting: they respect most intrinsic properties of the continuous differential operators. We show that these estimates are optimal in accuracy under mild smoothness conditions, and demonstrate their numerical quality. We also present applications of these operators, such as mesh smoothing, enhancement, and quality checking, and show results of denoising in higher dimensions, such as for tensor images.},

The bottom plate is a bare plane, and the top plate carries a rectangular grid of actuated pins that can translate in discrete increments under computer control. We propose to use this gripper to immobilize objects through frictionless contacts with three of the pins and the bottom plate, and to manipulate an object within a grasp by planning the sequence of pin configurations that will bring this object to a desired position and orientation. A detailed analysis of the problem geometry in configuration space is used to devise simple and efficient algorithms for grasp and manipulation planning. The proposed approach has been implemented and preliminary simulation experiments are discussed.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a novel tendon-driven bio-inspired robotic hand design for in-hand manipulation. Many dexterous robot hands are able to produce adaptive grasping, but only a few human-sized hands worldwide are able to produce fine motions of the object in the hand. One of the challenges for the near future is to develop human-sized robot hands with human dexterity. Most of the existing hands considered in the literature suffer from dry friction which creates unwanted backlash and non-linearities. These problems limit the accurate control of the fingers and the capabilities of the hand. Such was the case with our first fully actuated dexterous robot hand: the Laboratoire de Mécanique des Solides (LMS) hand.The mechanical design of the hand relies on a tendon-based transmission system. Developing a fully actuated dexterous robot hand requires the routing of the tendons through the finger for the actuation of each joint. This paper focuses on the evolution of the tendon routing; from the LMS hand to the new RoBioSS dexterous hand. The motion transmission in the new design creates purely linear coupling relations between joints and actuators. Experimental results using the same protocol for the previous hand and the new hand illustrate the evolution in the quality of the mechanical design. With the improvements of the mechanical behavior of the robotic fingers, the hand control software could be extensively simplified. The choice of a common architecture for all fingers makes it possible to consider the hand as a collaboration of four serial robots. Moreover, with the transparency of the motor-joint transmissions, we could use robust, industrial-grade cascaded feedback loops for the axis controls.An inside-hand manipulation task concerning the manipulation of a bottle cap is presented at the end of the paper. As proof of the robustness of the hand, demonstrations of the hand's capabilities were carried out continuously over three days at SPS IPC Drives international exhibition in Nuremberg, in November 2016.},

Unlike the kinematic representations based on the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters, the kinematic parameters in the POE formula vary smoothly with changes in the joint axes; ad hoc methods designed to address the inherent singularities in the D-H parameters are therefore unnecessary. After introducing the POE formula, we derive a least-squares kinematic calibration algorithm for general open chain mechanisms.},

   abstract = {The human hand’s versatility allows for robust and flexible grasping. To obtain such efficiency, many robotic hands include human biomechanical features such as fingers having their two last joints mechanically coupled. Although such coupling enables human-like grasping, controlling the inverse kinematics of such mechanical systems is challenging. Here we propose a cortical model for fine motor control of a humanoid finger, having its two last joints coupled, that learns the inverse kinematics of the effector. This neural model functionally mimics the population vector coding as well as sensorimotor prediction processes of the brain’s motor/premotor and parietal regions, respectively. After learning, this neural architecture could both overtly (actual execution) and covertly (mental execution or motor imagery) perform accurate, robust and flexible finger movements while reproducing the main human finger kinematic states. This work contributes to developing neuro-mimetic controllers for dexterous humanoid robotic/prosthetic upper-extremities, and has the potential to promote human–robot interactions.},

   abstract = {This paper deals with several of the basic concepts in the kinematics of mechanical hands. Several different types of finger contacts are modeled and used in a number synthesis of three-fingered hands. Screw theory is used to show which finger configurations allow complete immobilization of the gripped object relative to the fingers, and also allow for the manipulation of the object by the fingers while maintaining the grasp. Shown in this paper is how to determine the forces applied by the fingers on the object, and also how to compute the velocities of the fingers and the object. The analysis developed in this paper is shown to lead to a hand with three fingers, each with three turning joints, and having friction contacts with an object at three separate points.},

   abstract = {We present an example-based planning framework to generate semantic grasps, stable grasps that are functionally suitable for specific object manipulation tasks. We propose to use partial object geometry, tactile contacts, and hand kinematic data as proxies to encode task-related constraints, which we call semantic constraints. We introduce a semantic affordance map, which relates local geometry to a set of predefined semantic grasps that are appropriate to different tasks. Using this map, the pose of a robot hand with respect to the object can be estimated so that the hand is adjusted to achieve the ideal approach direction required by a particular task. A grasp planner is then used to search along this approach direction and generate a set of final grasps which have appropriate stability, tactile contacts, and hand kinematics. We show experiments planning semantic grasps on everyday objects and applying these grasps with a physical robot.},

A planner based on this approach has been implemented. This planner is consider ably faster than previous path planners and solves prob lems for robots with many more degrees of freedom (DOFs). The power of the planner derives both from the "good" properties of the potential function and from the efficiency of the techniques used to escape the local min ima of this function. The most powerful of these tech niques is a Monte Carlo technique that escapes local min ima by executing Brownian motions. The overall approach is made possible by the systematic use of distributed rep resentations (bitmaps) for the robot's work space and configuration space. We have experimented with the plan ner using several computer-simulated robots, including rigid objects with 3 DOFs (in 2D work space) and 6 DOFs (in 3D work space) and manipulator arms with 8, 10, and 31 DOFs (in 2D and 3D work spaces). Some of the most significant experiments are reported in this article.},

   abstract = {Service robots require easy programming methods allowing the unexperienced human user to easily integrate motion and perception skills or complex problem solving strategies. To achieve this goal, robots should learn from operators how and what to do considering hard- and software constraints. Various approaches modelling the man-machine skill transfer have been proposed. Systems following the Programming by Demonstration (PbD) paradigm that were developed within the last decade are getting closer to this goal. However, most of these systems lack the possibility for the user to supervise and influence the process of program generation after the initial demonstration was performed. In this paper a principle learning methodology is discussed, which allows to transfer human skills and to supervise the learning process including subsymbolic and symbolic task knowledge. Here, several existing approaches will be discussed and compared to each other. Moreover, a system approach is presented, integrating the overall process of skill transfer from a human to a robotic manipulation system. One major goal is to modify information gained by the demonstration in that way that different target systems are supported. The resulting PbD-system yields towards a hybrid learning approach in robotics to support natural programming based on human demonstrations and user advice.},

The procedure starts by computing a control that steers the given initial point to the desired target point for an extended system, in which a number of Lie brackets of the system vector fields are added to the right-hand side. The main point then is to use formal calculations based on the product expansion relative to a P. Hall basis, to produce another control that achieves the desired result on the formal level. It then turns out that this control provides an exact solution of the original problem if the given system is nilpotent. When the system is not nilpotent, one can still produce an iterative algorithm that converges very fast to a solution. Using the theory of feedback nilpotentization, one can find classes of non-nilpotent systems for which the algorithm, in cascade with a precompensator, produces an exact solution in a finite number of steps. We also include results of simulations which illustrate the effectiveness of the procedure.},

In particular, we analyze and generate gaits for mixed mechanical systems which are systems whose motion is simultaneously governed by both a set of non-holonomic velocity constraints and a notion of a generalized momentum being instantaneously conserved along allowable directions of motion. Through proper recourse to geometric mechanics, we are able to show that the resulting motion from a gait has two portions: a geometric and a dynamic contribution. The main challenge in motion planning for a mixed system is understanding how to separate the geometric and dynamic contributions of motion due to a general gait, thus simplifying gait analysis. In this paper, we take the first step towards addressing this challenge in a generalized framework. Finally, we verify the generality of our approach by applying our techniques to novel mechanical systems which we introduce in this paper as well as by verifying that seemingly different prior motion planning results could actually be explained using the gait analysis presented in this paper.},

What is unique about mixed systems is that when we express their dynamics in body coordinates, the motion of these system can be attributed to two decoupled terms: the geometric and dynamic phase shifts. In our prior work, we analyzed systems whose dynamic phase shift was null by definition. Purely mechanical and principally kinematic systems are two classes of mechanical systems that have this property. We generated gaits for these two classes of systems by intuitively evaluating their geometric phase shift and relating it to a volume integral under well-defined height functions.},

   abstract = {In this article, a recently developed learning approach for robot motion planning is extended and applied to two types of carlike robots: normal ones, and robots that can only move for ward. In this learning approach the motion planning process is split into two phases: the learning phase and the query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is incremen tally constructed in configuration space. This roadmap is an undirected graph where nodes correspond to randomly chosen configurations in free space and edges correspond to simple collision-free paths between the nodes. These simple motions are computed using a fast local method. In the query phase, this roadmap can be used to find paths between different pairs of configurations.The approach can be applied to normal carlike robots (with nonholonomic constraints) by using suitable local methods that compute paths feasible for the robots. Application to carlike robots that can move only forward demands a more fundamen tal adaptation of the learning method; that is, the roadmaps must be stored in directed graphs instead of undirected ones.We have implemented the planners, and we present experi mental results that demonstrate their efficiency for both robot types, even in cluttered workspaces. Also, we prove probabilis tic completeness of the planners.1. A robot is fully controllable iff the existence of a path in the open free C space implies the existence of a feasible path.2. By "metric," we simply mean a function of type C x C ? R+ without any restrictions.3. Formally, this requires a minor adaptation of the general outline of the learning algorithm, as presented in Section 3.1. Line 7. will be: if -connected(c, n) ? L( c, n) ? free C space then E = E U {(c, n)}.4. This does not necessarily hold if P1 consists of just one or two circular arcs of maximal curvature. In this case, however, P1 can be found directly with the local planner.5. We say a path Q lies within distance ? of a path R, iff ?q ? Q : ?r ? R : |q - r| ≤ ? (in C space).},

Several probabilistic roadmap planners have solved unusually difficult path planning problems, but their efficiency remains disappointing when the free space contains narrow passages. This paper provides a new technique to find free configurations into narrow corridors, sampling the configuration space using geometric features into the workspace and computing configurations close to the obstacles. An initial roadmap is built using spheres in low cost, next an improving connectivity phase based on “straightness”, “volume” and “normal vectors” features on the workspace is computed, and the roadmap is improved capturing a better connectivity of configuration space. Experiments show that the new approach is able to solve different benchmarks in motion planning problems containing difficult narrow corridors.},

   abstract = {The probabilistic roadmap approach is one of the leading motion planning techniques. Over the past eight years the technique has been studied by many different researchers. This has led to a large number of variants of the approach, each with its own merits. It is difficult to compare the different techniques because they were tested on different types of scenes, using different underlying libraries, implemented by different people on different machines. In this paper we provide a comparative study of a number of these techniques, all implemented in a single system and run on the same test scenes and on the same computer. In particular we compare collision checking techniques, basic sampling techniques, and node adding techniques. The results should help future users of the probabilistic roadmap planning approach to choose the correct techniques.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a generalization of the classic A* algorithm to the domain of sampling-based motion planning. The root assumptions of the A* algorithm are examined and reformulated in a manner that enables a direct use of the search strategy as the driving force behind the generation of new samples in a motion graph. Formal analysis is presented to show probabilistic completeness and convergence of the method. This leads to a highly exploitative method which does not sacrifice entropy. Many improvements are presented to this versatile method, most notably, an optimal connection strategy, a bias towards the goal region via an Anytime A* heuristic, and balancing of exploration and exploitation on a simulated annealing schedule. Empirical results are presented to assess the proposed method both qualitatively and quantitatively in the context of high-dimensional planning problems. The potential of the proposed methods is apparent, both in terms of reliability and quality of solutions found.},

   abstract = {This paper deals with motion planning for robots manipulating movable objects among obstacles. We propose a general manipulation planning approach capable of addressing continuous sets for modeling both the possible grasps and the stable placements of the movable object, rather than discrete sets generally assumed by the previous approaches. The proposed algorithm relies on a topological property that characterizes the existence of solutions in the subspace of configurations where the robot grasps the object placed at a stable position. It allows us to devise a manipulation planner that captures in a probabilistic roadmap the connectivity of sub-dimensional manifolds of the composite configuration space. Experiments conducted with the planner in simulated environments demonstrate its efficacy to solve complex manipulation problems.},
